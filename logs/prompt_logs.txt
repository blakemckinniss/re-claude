🐝 Recommended Swarm Agents: 1
👥 Recommended Agent Roles: coordinator
🛠️ Recommended MCP Tools: swarm_init, agent_spawn, task_orchestrate

[CRITICAL REMINDERS]
1. ALWAYS provide clear next steps after each action
2. SPAWN agents liberally - use Task tool for parallel execution when possible
3. KEEP memories updated - use mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage to store important context
4. USE web search liberally - leverage WebSearch and WebFetch for current information
5. BATCH operations - combine multiple tool calls in single messages for efficiency
6. CLAUDE CODE EXECUTES - MCP tools coordinate, Claude Code does ALL actual work
7. NO SEQUENTIAL TodoWrite calls - batch ALL todos together
8. AGENTS MUST USE HOOKS - every agent follows the coordination protocol
9. THINK VERY HARD - Use ultrathink for complex reasoning tasks
10. ALL DOCUMENTATION NEEDS TO BE EPHEMERAL - unless requested otherwise, do not store documentation permanently
11. USE THE SWARM COMMAND - always use the npx swarm spawn command to create agents
12. ALWAYS CREATE AGENTS FOR COMPLEX TASKS - if the task is complex, spawn agents to handle it

🚀 SWARM COMMAND: npx swarm spawn 1 agents for this task
🎭 AGENT ROLES: coordinator
🛠️ MCP TOOLS TO USE: swarm_init, agent_spawn, task_orchestrate

👤 USER PROMPT:
using /home/blake/workspace/re-claude/claude-code-hooks-reference.md as a reference, implement a comprehensive approach to creating an advanced hook system that forces adherance to claude-flow commands and forces claude-flow workflows in all scenarios; enforce CLAUDE.md mentality
